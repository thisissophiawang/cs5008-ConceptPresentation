## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete and test the code. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.
